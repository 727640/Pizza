 <p id="Life">Americans eat approximately 100 acres of pizza a day or about 350 slices per second. There are approximately 61,269 pizzerias in the United States. Each person in America eats about 46 pizza slices a year.The first pizza wasn’t made in Italy or USA. It was ancient Greeks who gave birth to Pizza. They used to bake flat and round large breads and topped them with veggies, potatoes, spices and olive oil. Definitely that was the earliest version of pizza known to have exist in human society. </p>
