 <p id="Life">Americans eat approximately 100 acres of pizza a day or about 350 slices per second. There are approximately 61,269 pizzerias in the United States. Each person in America eats about 46 pizza slices a year.The first pizza wasn’t made in Italy or USA. It was ancient Greeks who gave birth to Pizza. They used to bake flat and round large breads and topped them with veggies, potatoes, spices and olive oil. Definitely that was the earliest version of pizza known to have exist in human society. 18th century Italy was the country where the first commercial pizza originated. This commercial pizza didn’t have any kind of topping. It was just a plain, flat and round bread that was quite tasty and filling and were sold only to the poor because they were cheap. Street vendors in Naples used to sell these breads by the name ‘pizza’.Though pizza was still available in America before WWII when Italian immigrants used to sell the food within its community, returning soldiers actually made it popular in America and the pizza moved out of the quiet Italian community into mainstream American life.In America, the pizza industry grosses over $30 billion every year and 17% of U.S. restaurants are actually pizzerias.A survey report says that a minimum of 93% of Americans order and eat pizza at least once every month. On Super Bowl Sunday, 58% of Americans order pizza, which makes it the highest selling day for pizza than any average day in a given calendar year. Frozen pizza was invented in 1957 by Celentano Brothers. During the 1950s frozen pizza was available only in grocery stores. However, within just a few years, this variant became extremely popular and is today available in gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores and bars.An average American consumes 46 pizza slices in a single year. That’s quite an amount which explains why there are 69,000 pizzerias spread all across America. </p>
